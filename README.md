# Avengers-Spring2023
Repository for the Avenger's team project
The assignment was to make a text based adventure game from an SRS document that we recieved from another team in the class.  Extra points were awarded for
any team that followed the MVC architecture, which we did.  The README.txt inside the project explains the structure of the class data files, and all methods
are commented with the name of the person that worked on that specific part.
